				<p>BossyUI is more than a collection of directives.</p>
				<p>Based on Angular 2, CSS3, and HTML5, it's the culmination of tremendous efforts between students and working developers, sharing real-world experiences in creating something of which we are extremely proud.</p>
				<p>Weâ€™re very excited to share our front-end components to help streamline your project. Sponsored by Build.com and CSU, Chico, BossyUI fosters a connection between students and open source development.</p>
